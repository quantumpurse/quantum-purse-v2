//! Read-only queries against a CKB node.
//!
//! Every function here takes a `&dyn Client` and returns domain data —
//! balances, spendable capacity, DAO cells, transaction history. These are
//! wallet-domain operations that use the RPC, distinct from:
//!
//! - the `rpc` module (the `Client` trait and its concrete clients), and
//! - the `tx_builder` module (which constructs transactions).
//!
//! The `LocalNodeProcess` facade in `lib.rs` exposes these as methods so callers
//! don't need to touch the raw RPC handle.
