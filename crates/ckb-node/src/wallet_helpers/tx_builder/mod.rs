//! Transaction builders for CKB.
//!
//! This module provides builders for constructing various types of CKB transactions:
//! - Transfer transactions (sending CKB)
//! - DAO deposit transactions
//! - DAO prepare transactions (withdraw phase 1)
//! - DAO withdraw transactions (withdraw phase 2)
//! - Signing utilities for quantum-resistant locks
